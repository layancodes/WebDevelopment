# ProjectC

## Overview 
ProjectC is a Content Management System built with a focus on client-side rendering using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and JSON for dynamic content rendering and theme switching. The CMS leverages a JSON file to store and display content dynamically, with features like automatic content loading, theme switching, and view toggling between abstract and long-form content.

## Features 
- Fetches the content from "content.json" , which holds an array of objects containing titles, abstracts, and long-form content.
- The navigation bar is automatically populated with buttons corresponding to each title in the content.json file. Clicking on a button loads the corresponding content in the main content area.
-  Users can toggle between an abstract view (short description) and a long content view (full text) for each section using the "Abstract/Long Content" button.
- Supports switching between multiple themes (dark, day, contrast) via external CSS stylesheets. The active theme persists across content loads.
- Displays status messages, such as "Loading...", "Page Loaded", and other relevant notifications, including error messages, to keep users informed during content changes.

## How to use
- Clone the repository or download the project files.
- Ensure all essential files are in the same directory:
    "cms3.html" (main CMS file)
    "content.json" (content data file)
    CSS files (e.g., "Dark.css", "Day.css", "Contrast.css")
    Other external files (.jpg, .gif)
- Open the "cms3.html" file directly in a modern web browser.
