ProjectB is an AJAX-powered, PHP-based Content Management System with dynamic content rendering, asynchronous content loading, theme switching and theme persistence,  real-time visitor tracking, and error handling and  real-time status reporting. It fulfills the following:

- Fetches and dynamically displays markdown-based content using the Fetch API, ensuring fast and efficient updates without reloading the page.
- Implemetns a soft fail mechanism so that in case of errors (e.g., invalid request or unreadable file), the previous content remains visible, and a status message is displayed to inform the user.
- Allows users to toggle between themes (dark, day, contrast) via external CSS stylesheets and JavaScript, with the active theme persisting across content loads.
- Tracks and displays the number of visitors using a simple PHP-based counter mechanism.
- Handles errors gracefully and with real-time status reporting as it displays messages such as "Loading," "Page loaded successfully," or detailed error messages (e.g., HTTP status codes) in a dedicated status bar. 
- Automatically loads the "Welcome" section  as default content when the CMS is accessed for the first time.
- Includes buttons to simulate 404 (invalid request) and 503 (unreadable file) errors for robust error-handling demonstration.

To use 
- Clone the repository or download the project files.
- Place the project in a PHP-compatible server environment.
- Ensure all external  files (.css, .md, ,jpg, .gif, .txt) are in the same directory as the CMS.
- Open cms.php in your browser to start exploring.
